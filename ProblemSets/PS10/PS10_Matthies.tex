\maketitle

I was able to get the best penalty term of .001389495 for the logit model.

The only other figure I was able to get was a confusion matrix which had 89 percent accuracy of
predicting less than 50k earners and 79 percent accuracy of predicting earners greater than 50k earners.

My SVM took much too long to run and have an error so I gave up on the SVM.

My neural network also had problems running.

My kNN ran and I have a matrix containing the prediction, but when I went to summarize the 
accuracy I kept getting an error telling me my vector needed to be of length 1 and I am confused
by why it wants my matrix of test data with predictions normalized.
