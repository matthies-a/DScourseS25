3) It is statistics on how all of the top 900 rated baseball prospects performed last season, at their respective levels (Single-A, Double-A, Triple-A, etc.). There are some great stats in the table, but it would probably be better to use a table of older players for more useful prediction. I would probably like to use different independent variables than what are in this table like bat speed, exit velocities, or xwOBA, but I was constrained by how the graphs would read on R from the 'Baseball Savant' website. However, there is a package called "baseballr" which allows you to pull data from many different sites--I will just need to become more acquainted with how to use the package. I also found someone on GitHub by the name 'robert-frey' who has many good repositories on getting baseball data into R. 

4) It is all the monthly tracking of the M2 money supply coming from FRED. It all was a smooth process using the Fred API, but I will need to collect and combine multiple different variables if I were to choose something in monetary policymaking as my research project. The data seems pretty predictable in the first place, so I am not sure I will end up doing anything with it. I used the httr package.
